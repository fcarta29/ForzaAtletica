                                <p>"Before my first workout with Frank and Melissa at The Locker, I'd never lifted a weight bar. I didn't know what a WOD (workout of the day) is, or what AMRAP means. I was invited by a friend to try something new, and I was hoping that it would be something that I would enjoy and that I would want to do on a regular basis. My workout at The Locker kicked my butt and challenged me in a variety of new ways, and I loved it! I couldn't wait to go back, again and again. I soon invited my husband to try it with me, and it became a fun time to sweat and soreness that we could share! My hands are now callused, and I now speak the language of EMOMs, and I've seen new strength and muscles that I didn't know I had. The Locker offers top notch support and instruction. I never feel insecure for what I'm physically not able to do- we just make adjustments and keep moving. The workouts are never the same- it is impossible to feel bored at The Locker. I love the feeling after a workout, when I am completely exhausted and completely exhilarated! I am a stronger mom to my 4 kids because of my time spent at The Locker, I am so grateful!"  -Annie </p>

                                <p>"Melissa's comprehensive knowledge of the body and how it works allows her to design programs and workouts that make me move my body correctly and efficiently. Her positive and energetic presence always encourages me to strive for my personal best. I also love that she keeps the workouts varied and upbeat so I'm always exhausted by the end!" -Chelsea</p>
