                                <p>As a personal trainer, the success of my client is the measure by which I judge my own success. In order for a goal to be realistic, a client's fitness, nutrition, and attitude must support it. Having worked in a variety of personal training and physical therapy settings, I have experience with wide-ranging goals and abilities. Whether you are starting from scratch or are an accomplished athlete, I will work with you to develop a challenging and fun program that promotes not only your goals but also your personal understanding of a healthy lifestyle. Having participated in volleyball, track, yoga, tennis, soccer, swimming, and horseback riding throughout my life I have gained understanding of a wide variety of sport-specific training principles. My experiences as an aide and volunteer in a variety of physical therapy settings have strengthened my knowledge of prehab, rehab, and functional training. When I'm not training, I enjoy the diverse recreational activities available in Seattle. Running, playing volleyball, hiking, camping, skiing, playing piano, reading, cooking, and spending time with friends all score high on my list of favorite things to do!</p>

                                <p>Frank is, in short, a renaissance man. Having been a multi-sport athlete and scholar his whole life, he truly understands people from different walks of life (jocks and nerds alike). Harnessing this unique balance of muscle and brain power enables Frank to excel in all endeavors. Frank came from humble beginnings and learned early on that his path in life was going to be a bit more challenging than the normal. With hard work and dedication he earned an athletic scholarship to play football at the University of Southern California. Frank consistently made the Dean's List and was a 2-time winner of the David X Marke scholar athlete award. Frank also earned Academic All-American and Special Teams Player of the Year honors.After graduating, Frank briefly pursued professional football but quickly realized his injuries were accumulating and his time was up so he began his professional career as a system/software developer. With drive, teamwork, and leadership Frank quickly earned lead developer positions, where he managed teams of developers for numerous projects for Fortune 500 companies. Leveraging his established reputation and network, Frank started his own software consulting business, ByteKnowledge LLC, which he continues to own and manage today. Being a former athlete, Frank always gravitated towards working out, playing sports, and reading up on the latest information in nutrition and exercise. This passion led him to CrossFit, where he began training and competing. In his free time Frank enjoys playing with his son, reading biographies or philosophy, running and avidly partakes in CrossFit-style workouts and any sports related activities. </p>
