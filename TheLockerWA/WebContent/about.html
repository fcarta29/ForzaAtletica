                                <label>Frank Carta</label>
                                <p>Frank, having been a multi-sport athlete and scholar his whole life, truly understands people from different walks of life (jocks and nerds alike). Harnessing this unique balance of muscle and brain power enables Frank to excel in all endeavors. Frank came from humble beginnings and learned early on that his path in life was going to be a bit more challenging than the normal. With hard work and dedication he earned an athletic scholarship to play football at the University of Southern California. Frank consistently made the Dean's List and was a 2-time winner of the David X Marke scholar athlete award. Frank also earned Academic All-American and Special Teams Player of the Year honors. After graduating, Frank briefly pursued professional football but quickly realized his playing days were done with limited options to play and accumulating injuries. With that chapter in his life complete he decided to begin his professional career as a system/software developer. With drive, teamwork, and leadership Frank quickly earned lead developer positions, where he managed teams of developers for numerous projects for Fortune 500 companies. Leveraging his established reputation and network, Frank started his own software consulting business, ByteKnowledge LLC, which he continues to own and manage today. Being a former athlete, Frank always gravitated towards working out, playing sports, and reading up on the latest information in nutrition and exercise. This passion led him to CrossFit, where he began training and competing. In his free time Frank enjoys playing with his son, reading biographies or philosophy, running and avidly partakes in CrossFit-style workouts and any sports related activities. </p>
